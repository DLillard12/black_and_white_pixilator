Hi, welcome to my youtube channel, Noted by Danny. I intend to use this to note things, speak, and have a space for my thoughts to exist in a video format. I don't really have a theme set right now nor do I have a planned upload schedule but I do have this first video.

Dithering and divination.

I watched a really interesting video, Noise: A meditiation on the amplified whisper by Krkwd. A philosophical and technological channel and it had this cool dithering effect I wanted to emulate. I took a crack at it and I have something that I am happy with.

For the first half of this video we will cover the process of development and what I ended up with. In the second half I will talk about divination and how the images I create with my program relate to that.

I first started with the idea that I wanted to pixelate the image
