I got inspired by this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvR8__cVifI to create a black and white pixilator.
For the first half I will only do this on pictures, but may then transfer to images.
Currently I think the following will have to happen: 
1. Determine a default image size and resolution
2. Group pixels
3. Determine and set those pixels to either black or white.

So it appears that the video had some random factor that was adding in pixels that were characterized 'incorrectly'
I will be adding this stochastic element.

I was having issues with pixelation, because I was using the wrong variable name! Took me forever to find.
